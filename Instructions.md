## Don’t Stop Cooking VR Instructions

#### Game Overview:
The point of the game is to survive as long as you can.  In the kitchen there are three “orders” listed on the counter.  You must cook these meals as fast as you can before your boss’s patience runs out.  You can watch his patience both by observing his cardboard self which can be seen in both the kitchen and the cold storage, and by looking at the stat indicated by a skull icon in the kitchen on the glass panel.  Above the latter stat is a points stat.  Whenever you turn in a meal that you have finished at the plate above the order list, the points will go up, and the patience will go back up a bit as well.  Once the patience level reaches 0, it is game over.

#### Here are some of the parts of the game:
A navigational map.  You can pull this out and click on it to navigate between the cold storage (where various ingredients are kept), the pantry (where cooking tools and other ingredients are kept) and the kitchen (where you would be doing all of your cooking.)
A cook book.  You can use this to see how to make certain meals being ordered.
The two stoves.  First needing to turn it on with a click of their buttons, you must put a pan or stone slab on it and on that whatever food you want to cook.  While something is cooking on it a label with the progress will be shown above it.
The two ovens.  Similar to the stoves, but you don’t need to turn them on.  In order to cook things, you must close the hatches.  Labels inside of the ovens will show the cooking progress, so you are encouraged to open the ovens periodically to check on what you are cooking.
The craft table.  Put items on here to combine them into something, like putting vegetables together to make a salad.
The plate.  Put your finished meals on here when you are done to turn them in and make the boss happy.
The trash can.  It is a cylinder in the corner of the kitchen.  Drop an ingredient or a meal into it to throw them away.

#### How to cook something:
In order to cook something, you must either get a stone slab (the plane square thing in the pantry that looks like it’s made of stone) or a pan (also in the pantry) and put it on the stove or the oven.  The stove needs to be turned on to do anything, but this can be done on any part of this process.  You then need to put an item on it to cook.  If you are using the oven, you need to close the hatch before it can start cooking.  Be warned, if you leave the item cooking for too long or you cook something that wasn’t supposed to cook, it will burn and become a “failed dish”, which you don’t want to turn in as it brings down points and reduces the patience level.

#### Controls:
Starting with the Main Menu and Game Over menu.  To move around, move your thumb stick on the right controller in the direction you want to go, and then let go.  You will teleport over to the spot indicated.  To interact with the menu buttons, move you hand close to them and press the trigger.
Press X on the left controller to open the navigation map.  You can interact with it by pointing your right controller in a close range at the map, then pressing the trigger while pointing at the room you want to go to.
Press Y on the left controller to open the cookbook.  You can flip through the pages by, similarly to how the navigation map works, pointing in close range your right controller at the page and pressing the trigger.  Do this for the left page, and it will go back to the previous page.  Do this on the right page, and it will go to the next page.
Turning the stove on and off is done pretty much like in real life.  Just move your controller/hand into the button and move it back, and the button will be pressed.
Opening and closing the oven is similar to real life too.  Move your controller to the handle of the hatch you want to open, press the grip trigger to grab it, then pull.  When you let go the hatch will remain as far open as you made it.  Closing it again is the same process, just in the opposite direction.  The hatch will snap shut once you have gotten it close enough to being shut and let go of the handle.
