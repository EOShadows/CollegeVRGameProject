# College VR Game Project: Don't Stop Cooking in VR

In the beginning of the year 2022, we created a game called [Don't Stop Cooking](https://knocktane.itch.io/dont-stop-cooking) (WARNING contains a bit of blood).  
Using the **Unity** game engine, we created it as a submission to a game jam called the [Juice Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gdb-juice-jam), 
along with [another teammate](https://itch.io/profile/esperlihn), during a weeklong time limit.

The game is basically a cooking game with a horror twist, where you must cook the ordered dishes before your boss gets too impatient. The ordered dishes are randomized,
and vary in the amount of points that you get or satisfaction you make or the boss when you complete them.

Then during the Fall of that year, we needed an idea for a **VR Project** in the **Unreal Game Engine** for a class.  We not only enjoyed working on the Don't Stop Cooking game, but also
were really proud of how it had turned out.  So what better idea is there then to bring that game to VR?  It was something we thought would be cool to create and to play, but also
allowed an opportunity to work with VR design concepts we had been learning throughout the semester, such as various human-computer interaction techniques.  With all of the different
kinds of tasks in the original game, such as picking up ingredients, navigating to the correct appliance, and more, there was many possibilities of what we could allow a player to do in the
VR version.

The game was tested using the Oculus Quest 2.
